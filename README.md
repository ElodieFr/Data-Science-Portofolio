## Project 1: Analyze Educational System Data

**🎯Goal**

This project's goals is to carry out a preliminary exploratory analysis of data from the World Bank's 'EdStats All Indicator Query'. This analysis will help assess the relevance of the data in guiding Academy's expansion decisions into new countries

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Manipulate data using specialized Python libraries
- Perform univariate analysis and graphical representations

## Project 2: Prepare Data for a Public Health Organization

**🎯Goal**

The project focuses on getting familiar with the data, cleaning it, and exploring it to assess the feasibility of the application idea proposed by Santé Publique France. This includes identifying relevant variables, handling missing and outlier values, and conducting both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Particular attention was also paid to compliance with GDPR principles

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Data Processing
- Statistical Analysis (univariate and multivariate analyses, PCA)
- Data Visualization
- GDPR Compliance

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Descriptive statistics, Python, PCA

## Project 3: Forecast Building Energy Consumption

**🎯Goal**

This project aims to achieve two main objectives:

- To perform an exploratory analysis of energy consumption data from non-residential buildings
- To test and compare various prediction models to estimate CO2 emissions and total energy consumption, using a set of structural variables and the ENERGY STAR Score

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Feature Engineering
- Modeling:  machine learning algorithms (ElasticNet, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
- Optimized hyperparameters and evaluated models using cross-validation
- Select, train, and evaluate supervised learning models

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Machine Learning, supervised learning, SHAP model

## Project 4: Segment E-commerce Customers

**🎯Goal**

This project involves : 

- Performing customer segmentation based on their behavior and personal data using unsupervised learning methods
- Proposing a recommendation for how frequently this segmentation should be updated to ensure its long-term relevance

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning models
- Select and train unsupervised learning models
- Modeling and Segmentation
- Simulation of Update Frequency

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

## Project 5: Automatically Classify Consumer Goods

**🎯Goal**

The project is divided into two main phases:

- Feasibility Study: Assess the feasibility of an article classification engine using preprocessing and feature engineering techniques on unstructured data (text and images)
- Supervised Classification: Implement supervised image classification to automate product category assignment

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Define a strategy for developing a deep learning model
- Evaluate the performance of deep learning models
- Preprocess unstructured image data
- Preprocess unstructured text data
- Collect data that meets defined criteria via an API
- Reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data
- Use appropriate techniques for two-dimensional reduction

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Deep Learning, NLP, computer vision, supervised Classification

## Project 6: Frame an AI Project

**🎯Goal**

The project consists of the following steps:

- Backlog Definition: Formalize business needs as user stories, prioritize them using the MoSCoW method, and plan their implementation across successive sprints
- Cost Estimation and Profitability: Estimate human, technical, and financial costs, and demonstrate the medium-term profitability of the application
- Personal Data and Risk Management: Ensure GDPR compliance by identifying personal data processing activities and proposing an action plan to mitigate associated risks
- Sprint Planning: Structure the project into sprints and define the content of follow-up meetings (daily scrum, sprint review, retrospectives)

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Identifying business needs and writing user stories
- Estimating human, technical, and financial resources for a data science project
- Ensuring compliance with legal and ethical data collection regulations (GDPR)
- Planning and managing sprints in a data project workflow
